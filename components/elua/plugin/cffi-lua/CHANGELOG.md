# 01 August 2020 - 0.1.1

**Changes:**

- Build system enhancements
- CI enhancements
- We no longer ship a library/API (except a static library for embedded uses)
- Initial LuaRocks support (Windows support pending)
- Added option to disable tests

**Requirements:**

- No changes

**Library clarification:**

By default, you will only get a Lua module now. You can pass `-Dstatic=true`
to `meson` to switch the build to a static library; you will then get that
instead of a module. This is intended for systems that don't have Lua module
support - there you will want to link the FFI into the application instead.

It is not possible to build the static library and the module at the same
time, and usually the recommended thing is to build the module.

# 26 July 2020 - 0.1.0 - Initial release

This is the initial release of the `cffi` module. It is of beta quality.
See `STATUS.md` for status and `README.md` for building and usage.

Production usage is currently not recommended, since the module is not
battle tested. Testing is highly encouraged.

**Requirements:**

- Lua 5.1 - 5.4
- `libffi`
- `meson` 0.50+, optional `pkg-config`
- GCC 7+, Clang 8+ or Visual Studio 2017+ with updates recommended
  - Theoretical minimum is GCC 4.8, Clang 3.4 or any compiler with enough C++14
